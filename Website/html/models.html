                <h4>Top 20 Predicted Goal Scorers for the Coming Season</h4>
                <p>This model forecasts the top 20 players expected to score the most goals in the upcoming football season. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model utilizes player features such as matches played, minutes on the field, expected goals, non-penalty expected goals, progressive carries, and passes, among others. The output is based on a trained regression model that predicts goal-scoring potential for each player. The insights help analysts and coaches focus on key players and optimize their strategies for the season.</p>

                <h4>Team Data Analysis and Player Recommendations</h4>
                <p>This model leverages cosine similarity to recommend players for football teams based on performance metrics. By analyzing goals, assists, progressive carries, and passes, it calculates a comprehensive performance score for each player. Using these scores, the model identifies similar teams and recommends top-performing players from these teams who are not currently part of the target team. The recommendations are ranked based on the predicted performance score, enabling teams to strengthen their roster strategically.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Data Sources</h3>
            <p>
                We collected detailed player and team statistics from <a href="https://fbref.com/" target="_blank">FBref.com</a>, a trusted source for comprehensive football analytics. FBref provides in-depth data on players, teams, matches, and tournaments, making it an ideal platform for gathering performance metrics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data spans four football seasons, from 2020-2021 to 2023-2024, covering major leagues and tournaments such as La Liga, the Premier League, and the UEFA Champions League. Our primary focus was to extract performance metrics that could reveal insights into player efficiency, team strategies, and overall trends in football performance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Each season's data was scraped separately, capturing the dynamic nature of football where player forms, team compositions, and tactical approaches vary each year. The data was then organized into two comprehensive datasets:
            </p>
            <ul class="data-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Player Stats:</strong> This dataset includes individual player-level metrics such as:
                    <ul class="sub-list">
                        <li><span class="bullet">‚öΩ</span> Goals, assists, and shots.</li>
                        <li><span class="bullet">üîë</span> Passing accuracy and key passes.</li>
                        <li><span class="bullet">üõ°Ô∏è</span> Defensive actions like tackles, interceptions, and blocks.</li>
                        <li><span class="bullet">‚è±Ô∏è</span> Minutes played and appearances.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Team Stats:</strong> This dataset aggregates team-level metrics, such as:
                    <ul class="sub-list">
                        <li><span class="bullet">üìä</span> Possession percentage and passing accuracy.</li>
                        <li><span class="bullet">üéØ</span> Total shots, shots on target, and expected goals (xG).</li>
                        <li><span class="bullet">üõ°Ô∏è</span> Defensive metrics like clean sheets and tackles per match.</li>
                        <li><span class="bullet">üìï</span> Disciplinary data including yellow and red cards.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                The collected data serves as the foundation for our analysis, allowing us to explore various aspects of football performance, such as the correlation between player metrics and match outcomes, the impact of team formations on success rates, and trends in disciplinary actions over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                By leveraging FBref's robust and reliable dataset, we ensured the accuracy and relevance of the insights derived from our analysis. The structured data collection process enabled us to combine season-specific statistics into unified datasets for comprehensive evaluations and visualizations.

        <section class="data-section data-scraping">
            <h3 class="section-title">Data Collection Process</h3>
            <h4>1. Collecting Player Stats</h4>
            <p>
                Player statistics were scraped using <code>Selenium</code> and <code>BeautifulSoup</code>. Selenium was used to handle dynamic content on the FBref website. For example, the following code was used to scrape data for the 2020-2021 La Liga season:
            </p>
            <pre><code>from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

# URL for La Liga 2020-2021 player stats
url = 'https://fbref.com/en/comps/12/2020-2021/stats/2020-2021-La-Liga-Stats'

# Setup Selenium with headless Chrome
chrome_options = Options()
chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)

# Open the URL and extract the page source
driver.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(driver.page_source, 'html.parser')

# Find the player stats table by its ID
table = soup.find('table', {'id': 'stats_standard'})
df = pd.read_html(str(table))[0]  # Parse the table into a DataFrame

# Save the data to a CSV file
df.to_csv('la_liga_2020_2021_player_stats.csv', index=False)</code></pre>
            <p>
                This process was repeated for the 2017-2018, 2018-2019, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021 seasons, resulting in four separate files. The files were later combined into a single dataset: <code>Player_stats.csv</code>.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Collecting Team Stats</h4>
            <p>
                Team statistics were collected using <code>BeautifulSoup</code> and <code>requests</code>. We fetched URLs for each team, scraped relevant tables, and combined the data. Here‚Äôs an example of extracting team stats for the 2020-2021 La Liga season:
            </p>
            <pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

# Fetch team URLs
response = requests.get('https://fbref.com/en/comps/12/2020-2021/2020-2021-La-Liga-Stats')
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
team_links = [f"https://fbref.com{a['href']}" for a in soup.find_all('a', href=True) if '/squads/' in a['href']]

# Scrape "Scores & Fixtures" and "Shooting" tables for each team
for team_url in team_links:
    team_page = requests.get(team_url)
    team_soup = BeautifulSoup(team_page.text, 'html.parser')
    scores_fixtures = pd.read_html(str(team_soup), match="Scores & Fixtures")[0]
    # Process and save the data...</code></pre>
            <p>
                This process was also repeated for four seasons and the resulting files were merged into <code>Team_Stats.csv</code>.
            </p>

            <h4>3. Collecting Additional Team Data</h4>
<p>
    In addition to the initial <code>Team_Stats.csv</code> dataset, another dataset named <code>Team Dataset 2</code> (originally <code>cleaned_dataset_no_index.csv</code>) was created. This dataset aggregates and enhances the initial team statistics with additional cleaned and processed metrics. It combines player and team-level information for a more comprehensive analysis.
</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

# Load the cleaned dataset
cleaned_data = pd.read_csv('cleaned_dataset_no_index.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(cleaned_data.head())</code></pre>
<p>
    The <code>Team Dataset 2</code> was used alongside the original <code>Team_Stats.csv</code> for advanced team-level analysis, providing deeper insights into team dynamics and player contributions.

            <h4>Data Cleaning Steps</h4>
            <p>
                Data cleaning is a crucial part of the process to ensure accuracy and usability. Here are the steps we followed to clean our dataset:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Removed rows with missing values for key metrics like goals and assists.</li>
                <li>Renamed ambiguous column headers to more descriptive names.</li>
                <li>Filtered out players with zero minutes played to focus on active participants.</li>
                <li>Removed duplicate rows and aggregate data like "Team Totals".</li>
            </ul>
            <pre>
        <code>
        # Remove missing values
        df = df.dropna(subset=["Goals", "Assists"])
        
        # Rename columns
        df.rename(columns={"Gls": "Goals", "Ast": "Assists"}, inplace=True)
        
        # Filter active players
        df = df[df["Minutes Played"] > 0]
        </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                Data visualizations are essential for interpreting complex datasets and conveying insights effectively. By representing data visually, we can identify patterns, trends, and outliers that may not be apparent in raw data. Below are some of the visualizations we created to illustrate key findings from our analysis:

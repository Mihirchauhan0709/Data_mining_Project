                    <h4>Predicting Match Win Probabilities</h4>
                    <p>
                        This model calculates the win probabilities for two teams facing each other using player-level and team-level stats. The prediction is based on a machine learning model trained on historical data, including features such as goals scored, assists, progressive passes, and defensive metrics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By aggregating individual player stats into team-level metrics, the model ensures comprehensive analysis. For example, if Team A has a stronger attack (e.g., higher expected goals and progressive carries) and Team B has better defense (e.g., fewer goals conceded), the model balances these metrics to predict win probabilities.
                    </p>
                    <h5>How it Works:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Aggregates player-level stats into team-level features like average goals and assists.</li>
                        <li>Uses these features to predict the win probabilities for each team.</li>
                        <li>Normalizes the probabilities to provide insights for both teams in a match-up.</li>
                    </ul>
